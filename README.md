# Whats a Tracker?

A tracker is a piece of software that reads a succession of events, expressed as text, and transforms them into instructions sent to a sampling engine or a synthesizer to generate sound (and in the best of cases, music). Various tracker software have different syntax to suit their specificities, but usually, events are organised as tracks (or channels), placed side by side, with each line representing a step (or tick) which may contain data to play or not.
